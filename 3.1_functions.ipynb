    "\n",
    "Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: ```print()``` and ```type()```. You've also used the functions ```str()```, ```int()```, ```bool()``` and ```float()``` to switch between data type. These are built-in functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling a function is easy. To get the type of ```3.0``` and store the output as a new variable, ```result```, you can use the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = type(3.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The general recipe for calling functions is thus:\n",
    "```\n",
    "output = function_name(input)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "* Use ```print()``` in combination with ```type()``` to print out the type of ```var1```.\n",
    "* Use ```len()``` to get the length of the list ```var1```. Wrap it in a ```print()``` call to directly print it out.\n",
    "* Use ```int()``` to convert ```var2``` to an integer. Store the output as ```out2```.\n",

    "In this exercise, you'll only have to specify ```iterable``` and ```reverse```, not ```key```. The first input you pass to ```sorted()``` will obviously be matched to the ```iterable``` argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify ```reverse``` without changing anything about ```key```, you can use ```=```:\n",
