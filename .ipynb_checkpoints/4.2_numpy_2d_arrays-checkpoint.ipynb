    "\n",
    "In this exercise, ```baseball``` is a list of lists. The main list contains 4 elements. Each of these elements is a list containing the height and the weight of 4 baseball players, in this order. ```baseball``` is already coded for you in the script.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "* Use ```np.array()``` to create a 2D Numpy array from ```baseball```. Name it ```np_baseball```.\n",
    "* Print out the type of ```np_baseball```.\n",
    "* Print out the ```shape``` attribute of ```np_baseball```. Use ```np_baseball.shape```.\n"
